# AirPoseUnityDemo
 A demo project using the Nreal Air as a XR headset for unity on windows


## Getting Started
Clone / Download this repo and import into unity hub

### Open the scene
<br>
Once you open the project in unity navigate to Assets/Scenes <br><br>
Open the "AirPoseDemo" Scene and press play at the top. <br><br>
If your glasses are connected you should be able to move them around and see cubes in the editors Game window.

### Displaying on glasses
Depending on how many displays you have and what display your Nreal Air shows up as varies from user to user. I havent looked much into setting up a menu so its hard set. <br><br>
To change this goto the main camera under XRRig->Camera Offset->Main Camera in the tree.<br>
Set "Target Display" to the correct number for your glasses.<br><br>
You should now be able to build/play with the game opening on the glasses.
